# laravelFileUpload
Small reference app for creating a file-upload system in laravel using vue components


This uses Laravel 5.7 ( check the composer.json and package.json for specific dependency information )
I followed https://codeburst.io/upload-and-manage-files-with-laravel-and-vue-915378c8b2a4 tutorial to
understand how the whole process worked without reliance on third party packages ( like other tutorials ),
then ran it locally to learn.

I use this as a reference for whenever I am involved in a project that requires me to manage files in a Laravel project.

Great reference for:
- vue component that is based entirely out of app.js and not within a single-file-component
- native laravel file management
